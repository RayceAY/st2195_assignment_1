## Practice Assignment 1 R Markdown File 

This assignment is very **important** as it sets the foundations for future assignments. It requires the use of **RStudio** and **Sypder** to create a *R script* and *Python Script* respectively. Both scripts requires students to print **all integers between 1 to 10** including 1 & 10 to screen which an additional point if a **for loop** is used. All of these scripts will be housed in a **Git Repository**.
